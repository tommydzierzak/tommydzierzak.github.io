						<h3>FirstBuild - <span style="font-size:0.7em;"><i>Louisville, KY</i><br>August - December 2017</span></h3>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/1B.jpg" alt="" /></span>While at FirstBuild I got to work on some projects that I really enjoyed. I spent a lot of time pototyping, demoing, then iterating based on feedback. While making
						prototypes I utilized 3D modeling, 3D printing, and silicone casting. I had the opportunity to work closely with the industural design team to make sure our product worked flawlessly and was a joy to use. On several occasions I was able to
						help
						demonstrate prototypes to the CEO & CTO of GE Appliances. Additionally, I also was working to diagnose an issue with an existing oven temperature probe that spans many product lines at GE Appliances. To test probes I created my own data logger
						to
						collect data and find the root of the issue with the inaccurate temperatures the probe was reading. Based on these results my team was able to propose changes to GEA on how to improve the current temperature probe.<br></p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/cheesecake.jpeg" alt="" /></span>At FirstBuild I felt a real passion for my studies as an Engineer. I had the opportunity to learn and practice many skills during work and many times after
						work spending time on my own projects. I was able to increase the breadth of my 3D printing skills and am now able to untilize flexible material effectivly. For many project we would often need a quick part, for this I quickly became very
						talented in using the laser cutters. After work hours I had the opportunity to improve my skills on the CNC router. I also was able to become certified on the water jet and was able to cut some parts for my personal 3D printer.<br></p>
